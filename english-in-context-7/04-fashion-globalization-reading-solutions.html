        <div class="subtitle">English in Context 7 | Topic 4 | SOLUTIONS</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">A) Reading Comprehension</div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">1.</span> What percentage of global carbon emissions does the fashion industry produce?
        <div class="answer">10% of global carbon emissions</div>
        <div class="note">(More than all international flights and maritime shipping combined)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">2.</span> How much water is needed to produce one cotton T-shirt?
        <div class="answer">Approximately 2,700 litres of water</div>
        <div class="note">(Enough drinking water for one person for 2.5 years)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">3.</span> What was the Rana Plaza disaster and why was it significant?
        <div class="answer">The Rana Plaza disaster was a garment factory collapse in Bangladesh in 2013 that killed over 1,100 workers. It was significant because it brought international attention to the unsafe working conditions and exploitation in the fast fashion industry.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">4.</span> According to the text, why do fast fashion brands release new collections so frequently?
        <div class="answer">To encourage consumers to constantly update their wardrobes / to make people buy more clothes more often.</div>
        <div class="note">(Brands release new collections every few weeks)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">5.</span> What is meant by "circular fashion"?
        <div class="answer">Circular fashion means creating clothes that can be fully recycled at the end of their life / designing fashion in a way that materials can be reused in a continuous cycle.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="section-title">B) Critical Thinking (Sample Answers)</div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">6.</span> The text mentions that sustainable fashion is more expensive. Do you think this is fair? Why / Why not?
        <div class="answer">Sample answer: Yes, it is fair because sustainable fashion reflects the TRUE cost of production – fair wages, safe conditions, and environmentally friendly materials. The low prices of fast fashion only exist because of exploitation and environmental damage. Workers deserve fair pay.</div>
        <div class="note">Alternative view: No, because it makes ethical fashion only accessible to wealthy people, creating a two-tier system where only the rich can afford to be ethical consumers.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">7.</span> What solutions does the text suggest for reducing the negative impacts of the fashion industry?
        <div class="answer">• Using organic or recycled materials<br>
        • Ensuring fair wages and safe working conditions<br>
        • Producing clothing designed to last<br>
        • Embracing circular fashion (fully recyclable clothes)<br>
        • Buying fewer, higher-quality items<br>
        • Caring for clothes properly to make them last longer</div>
    </div>

    <div class="answer-box">
        <span class="number">8.</span> The text says "the cheapest option isn't always the most economical." Explain what this means using examples from the text.
        <div class="answer">This means that although fast fashion items cost less initially (e.g. €5 T-shirt vs. €30 sustainable T-shirt), they need to be replaced more frequently because they are lower quality. The text mentions people now keep clothes for "half as long." If you buy a sustainable T-shirt that lasts 5 years vs. buying 5 cheap T-shirts that wear out quickly, the sustainable option may actually cost less overall. Additionally, the "hidden costs" – environmental damage and human exploitation – are paid by society and future generations.</div>
