# Literature Analysis: "Normal People" by Sally Rooney

## Context: Adulthood and Relationships
In Unit 1, we analyze an excerpt from Sally Rooney's *Normal People*. The story follows Connell and Marianne as they navigate school, social status, and their evolving relationship.

## Key Questions for Analysis
1.  **Social Status:** How do Connell and Marianne's backgrounds differ? (Connell is popular but from a lower-income background; Marianne is wealthy but a social outcast).
2.  **Internal Conflict:** Why is Connell hesitant to be seen with Marianne in school? (He is afraid of the social embarrassment and being associated with an "object of disgust").
3.  **Narrative Perspective:** What perspective is the story told from? (Third-person limited, focusing on Connell’s perspective).
4.  **Register:** How would you describe the language used? (Neutral to informal, very contemporary).

## Writing Task: Blog Post
Write a blog post (approx. 200 words) about the challenges of "growing up" and the pressure to conform in school. Use at least 5 words from our vocabulary list (e.g., *alienate, assert, rebellion, maturity, role models*).

# Solutions / Teacher Notes
1.  **Answers to Q1-4:** Based on the textbook analysis. Connell's mother cleans for Marianne's family, adding a class dimension to their relationship.
2.  **Writing Rubric:** Check for proper blog format (Title, engaging intro, body paragraphs, call to action/closing).
