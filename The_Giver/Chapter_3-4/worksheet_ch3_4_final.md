# SOLUTIONS (Teacher's Copy)

## Section I: Vocabulary
1. **Remorse**: Deep regret or guilt.
2. **Chortle**: A breathy, gleeful laugh.
3. **Gravitate**: To move toward or be attracted to something.
4. **Serene**: Calm, peaceful, and untroubled.
5. **Infraction**: A violation or infringement of a law or agreement.

## Section II: Analysis
1. The apple "changed" in mid-air (it briefly showed color/depth). Jonas was confused because everything in the community is monochromatic and "the same."
2. Most citizens have dark eyes; pale eyes are rare. This suggests that even genetic variety is being suppressed in favor of "Sameness."

## Section III: The House of the Old
1. The ritual is clinical but respectful. It shows that the elderly are cared for but also completely separated from the productive life of the community.
2. The release of a newchild is seen as a failure/tragedy, while the release of the elderly is celebrated as a "full life," though both remain mysterious.

## Section IV: Discussion
1. (Individual) It likely functions as a tool for social engineering and behavioral control.
2. (Individual) Focus on the trade-off between security and agency.
